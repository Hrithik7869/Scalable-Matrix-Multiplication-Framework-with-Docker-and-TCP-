# Scalable-Matrix-Multiplication-Framework-with-Docker-and-TCP-
Developed a containerized matrix multiplication system using Docker Compose. A central container splits a 4Ã—4 matrix row-wise and distributes tasks to four worker containers over TCP. Each worker computes its partial result and sends it back for final assembly.
